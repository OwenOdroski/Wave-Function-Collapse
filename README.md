# Wave-Function-Collapse
A simple wave function collapse algorithm

Made to look like a layout of a city or small town, entirely in JavaScript.

Created with 10 pixel by 10 pixel tiles, put into small 3x3 grids. Randomized with certain conditions that it has to follow like the "roads" have to be connected.
